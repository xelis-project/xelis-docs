== NAME
xelis_miner - run a XELIS miner.

== SYNOPSIS
[synopsis]
xelis_miner [OPTIONS] [FILENAME_LOG]

== DESCRIPTION

The *xelis_miner* application is a **CPU miner** that allows you to participate in securing the **XELIS** network by contributing your computerâ€™s central processing unit (CPU) power to validate transactions and produce new blocks.

Unlike specialized hardware such as GPUs or ASICs, CPU mining uses the processing resources already built into most desktop and laptop computers, making it the **most accessible** way to start mining.

This approach is particularly useful for newcomers who want to support the network, test configurations, or mine with spare capacity on personal machines.

While CPUs are generally less powerful than dedicated mining hardware, they provide an easy, **low-barrier** entry point into the XELIS ecosystem.

The XELIS CPU miner is **lightweight**, integrates directly with the node software, and requires minimal setup,
allowing anyone to start mining and earning XEL rewards with just a few configuration steps.

== OPTIONS

`-h`::
`--help`::
Print help (see a summary with `-h`).

`-V`::
`--version`::
Print version.

`--network`::
Select the blockchain network the node will connect to.
+
Possible values: `mainnet`, `testnet`, `devnet`
+
Default: `mainnet`

`-m, --miner-address <address>`::
Set the wallet `<address>` to mine and receive block rewards.

`--daemon-address <address>`::
Set the daemon `<address>` to connect to for mining.
+
Default: `127.0.0.1:8080`

`--api-bind-address <address>`::
Set the bind `<address>` for stats API.

`-n, --num-threads <n>`::
Set the number of threads to use to `<n>` (at least 1, max: 65535). By default, this will try to detect the number of threads available on your CPU.

`-w, --worker <name>`::
Set the worker `<name>` to be displayed on daemon side.
Default: `default`

`--log-level <level>`::
Set the log level to `<level>`.
Available values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.
By default, the log level is set to `info`.

`--file-log-level <level>`::
Set the file log level to `<level>`.
+
Available values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.
This is useful for having a different log level for the file log than the console log.
+
By default, the file log level is set to value passed to `--log-level` (which is also `info` by default).


`--disable-file-logging`::
Disable the miner from writing logs to a log file.

`--disable-file-log-date-based`::
Disable date-based log filenames. If disabled, the log file will be named `xelis-miner.log` instead of `YYYY-MM-DD.xelis-miner.log`.

`--auto-compress-logs`::
Enable the log file auto-compression. If enabled, the log file will be compressed every day. This will only work if file logging is enabled.

`--disable-log-color`::
Disable the usage of colors in the log display output.

`--disable-interactive-mode`::
Disable terminal interactive mode. You will not be able to write CLI commands in it or have an updated prompt.

`--logs-path <path>`::
Set the directory `<path>` where log files are stored.
+
By default, it will be `logs/` of the current directory. It must end with a `/` to be a valid folder.
+
Default: `logs/`

`--logs-modules <module>`::
Module configuration for logs.
A comma must separate each module name.
Example: To disable logging for two modules `mod_1` and `mod_2`, use: `--logs-modules mod_1=off,mod_2=off`.


`--datetime-format <format>`::
Change the datetime format used by the logger.
+
Default: `[%Y-%m-%d] (%H:%M:%S%.3f)`


 `--benchmark <benchmark>`::
Enable the `<benchmark>` mode with the specified algorithm
Possible values: `v1`, `v2`

`--iterations <n>`::
Set the number of iterations to run the benchmark to `<n>`.
+
Default: `100`

`--config-file <file>`::
Load the daemon configuration from <file>. JSON format.

`--generate-config-template`::
Generate the template at the `--config-file` path.

`--disable-ascii-art`::
Disable the ascii art at startup.

== FILENAME_LOG
Log filename.

Sets the filename where logs will be saved. This log file will be stored in `logs` directory.

NOTE: This is only the filename, not the full path. The log file is rotated every day and has the format `YYYY-MM-DD.xelis-miner.log`.

Default: `xelis-miner.log`
