.SH "NAME"
xelis_miner \- run a XELIS miner.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
xelis_miner [OPTIONS] [FILENAME_LOG]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBxelis_miner\fP application is a \fBCPU miner\fP that allows you to participate in securing the \fBXELIS\fP network by contributing your computerâ€™s central processing unit (CPU) power to validate transactions and produce new blocks.
.sp
Unlike specialized hardware such as GPUs or ASICs, CPU mining uses the processing resources already built into most desktop and laptop computers, making it the \fBmost accessible\fP way to start mining.
.sp
This approach is particularly useful for newcomers who want to support the network, test configurations, or mine with spare capacity on personal machines.
.sp
While CPUs are generally less powerful than dedicated mining hardware, they provide an easy, \fBlow\-barrier\fP entry point into the XELIS ecosystem.
.sp
The XELIS CPU miner is \fBlightweight\fP, integrates directly with the node software, and requires minimal setup,
.br
allowing anyone to start mining and earning XEL rewards with just a few configuration steps.
.sp

.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-n, \-\-num\-threads <n>\fP
.RS 4
Set the number of threads to use to \f(CR<n>\fP (at least 1, max: 65535). By default, this will try to detect the number of threads available on your CPU.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-w, \-\-worker <name>\fP
.RS 4
Set the worker \f(CR<name>\fP to be displayed on daemon side.
.br
Default: \f(CRdefault\fP
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-log\-level <level>\fP
.RS 4
Set the log level to \f(CR<level>\fP.
.br
Available values are \f(CRtrace\fP, \f(CRdebug\fP, \f(CRinfo\fP, \f(CRwarn\fP, \f(CRerror\fP.
.br
By default, the log level is set to \f(CRinfo\fP.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-file\-log\-level <level>\fP
.RS 4
Set the file log level to \f(CR<level>\fP.
.sp
Available values are \f(CRtrace\fP, \f(CRdebug\fP, \f(CRinfo\fP, \f(CRwarn\fP, \f(CRerror\fP.
.br
This is useful for having a different log level for the file log than the console log.
.sp
By default, the file log level is set to value passed to \f(CR\-\-log\-level\fP (which is also \f(CRinfo\fP by default).
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-disable\-file\-logging\fP
.RS 4
Disable the miner from writing logs to a log file.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-disable\-file\-log\-date\-based\fP
.RS 4
Disable date\-based log filenames. If disabled, the log file will be named \f(CRxelis\-miner.log\fP instead of \f(CRYYYY\-MM\-DD.xelis\-miner.log\fP.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-auto\-compress\-logs\fP
.RS 4
Enable the log file auto\-compression. If enabled, the log file will be compressed every day. This will only work if file logging is enabled.
.RE
.sp
