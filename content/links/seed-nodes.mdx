# Seed Nodes (7)

These are seed nodes hosted by us. The network does not requires them to be up at all time because XELIS is a decentralized network.
However we provide them for others who can't run one for whatever reasons.  
Check out https://status.xelis.io/ for server uptime, latency and node information.
