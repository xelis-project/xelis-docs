# Bootstrap

## Bootstrap Script

This script makes it easy to onboard onto the network with just one step.  
On the first launch, it will ask if you want to bootstrap from the latest snapshot or sync from scratch using boost sync.

```bash copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.xelis.io/scripts/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

## Full Database

If you don't want to sync the blockchain from the beginning and start at the latest snapshot, you can download the entire database.  
It's updated every day.
