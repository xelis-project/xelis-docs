title: XELIS Wallet Configuration
---

## NAME

**xelis_wallet** - run a xelis miner.

## SYNOPSIS

**xelis_wallet** \[OPTIONS\]

## DESCRIPTION

**xelis_wallet** is the application that allows you to **securely**
store, send, and receive **XEL** (and any other asset available on the
**XELIS** blockchain).

It connects to the blockchain through the daemon or a remote node,
enabling you to manage your funds while maintaining full control of your
private keys.

By default, the wallet operates in a **non-custodial** way only - you
hold the keys to your coins, ensuring that no third party can access or
move your funds.

Beyond basic transfers, the XELIS wallet also supports **advanced
features** such as interacting with multisig, smart contracts, managing
custom assets, and monitoring your transaction history.

For the highest level of privacy and security, it is **highly
recommended** to connect your wallet to a daemon you manage, making your
setup fully trustless and independent while contributing to the health
of the XELIS network.

A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest **xelis_wallet**
documentation can be viewed at https://docs.xelis.io/getting-started/configuration/xelis_wallet or https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-docs/resources/manpages/xelis_wallet/xelis_wallet.html

# OPTIONS

`-h`, `--help`

> Print help (see a summary with `-h`).

`-V`, `--version`

> Print version.

`--network`

> Select the blockchain network the node will connect to.
>
> Possible values: `mainnet`, `testnet`, `devnet`
>
> Default: `mainnet`

`--rpc-bind-address <address>`

> Set the bind `<address>` to use for the RPC server. By default, the
> bind address is set to `127.0.0.1:8080`.

`--rpc-username <username>`

> Set the `<username>` to use for RPC server authentication. By default,
> no username is set.  
> NOTE: A username is required if a `--rpc-passweod` is provided.

`--rpc-password <password>`

> Set the `<password>` to use for RPC server authentication. By default,
> no password is set.

>
>
> **Note**  
> A password is required if a `--rpc-username` is provided.

`--rpc-threads <n>`

> Set the number of workers to spawn for the HTTP server to `<n>`.
> If not provided, it will use the available parallelism.

`--daemon-address <address>`

> Set the address of the daemon to use.
>
> Default: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

`--offline-mode`

> Enable offline mode. This will stop the wallet from connecting to the
> daemon, and it **will not** be able to send transactions.

`--precomputed-tables-l1 <size>`

> Sets the L1 `<size>` for precomputed tables. By default, it is set to
> 26 (L1\_FULL).  
> At each increment of 1, the size of the table is doubled
> `L1_FULL = 26`, `L1_MEDIUM = 18`, `L1_LOW = 13`.  
> 
> Default: `26`

`--precomputed-tables-path <path>`

> Set the path to use for precomputed tables to `<path>`  
> By default, the current directory is used.

`--log-level <level>`

> Set the log level to `<level>`.  
> Available values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.  
> By default, the log level is set to `info`.

`--file-log-level <level>`

> Set the file log level to `<level>`.
>
> Available values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.  
> This is useful for having a different log level for the file log than
> the console log.
>
> By default, the file log level is set to value passed to `--log-level`
> (which is also `info` by default).

`--disable-file-logging`

> Disable the wallet from writing logs to a log file.

`--disable-file-log-date-based`

> Disable date-based log filenames. If disabled, the log file will be
> named `xelis-wallet.log` instead of `YYYY-MM-DD.xelis-wallet.log`.

`--auto-compress-logs`

> Enable the log file auto-compression. If enabled, the log file will be
> compressed every day. This will only work if file logging is enabled.

`--disable-log-color`

> Disable the usage of colors in the log display output.

`--disable-interactive-mode`

> Disable terminal interactive mode. You will not be able to write CLI
> commands in it or have an updated prompt.

`--filename-log <filename>`

> Set log filename.
>
> By default `<filename>` is xelis-wallet.log. `<filename>` will be
> stored in `logs` directory, this is only the filename, **not** the
> full path. The log file is rotated every day and has the format
> `YYYY-MM-DD.xelis-wallet.log`.
>
> Default: `xelis-wallet.log`

`--logs-path <path>`

> Set the directory `<path>` where log files are stored.
>
> By default, it will be `logs/` of the current directory. It must end
> with a `/` to be a valid folder.
>
> Default: `logs/`

`--logs-modules <module>`

> Module configuration for logs.  
> A comma must separate each module name.  
> Example: To disable logging for two modules `mod_1` and `mod_2`, use:
> `--logs-modules mod_1=off,mod_2=off`.

`--datetime-format <format>`

> Change the datetime format used by the logger.
>
> Default: `[%Y-%m-%d] (%H:%M:%S%.3f)`

`--wallet-path <path>`

> Set the `<path>` for wallet storage to open/create a wallet at this
> location.
>
> If not specified, the wallet will be created inside the `wallets`
> folder of the current directory with its nam.

`--password <password>`

> Set the password to use for the wallet file.

`--seed <seed>`

> Restores a wallet using seed.

`--n-decryption-threads <n>`

> Set the number of threads we want to use during ciphertext decryption
> to `<n>`.
>
> Default: `16`

`--network-concurrency <n>`

> Set the concurrency configuration for the Network Handler to `<n>`.
>
> Default: `16`

`--enable-xswd`

> Enable XSWD mode. This will enable the wallet to use the XSWD protocol
> to communicate with applications securely.
>
> By default, the XSWD mode is disabled.

`--disable-history-scan`

> Disable the history scan This will prevent syncing old TXs/blocks Only
> blocks / transactions caught by the network handler will be stored,
> not the old ones.

`--force-stable-balance`

> Force the wallet to use a stable balance only during transaction
> creation. This will prevent the wallet from using unstable balances
> and prevent any orphaned transactions due to DAG reorg. This only
> works if the wallet is in online mode.

`--config-file <file>`

> Load the daemon configuration from `<file>`. JSON format.

`--generate-config-template`

> Generate the template at the `--config-file` path.

`--disable-ascii-art`
