## Introduction

To give an easier way to install the software, we provide precompiled binaries for different platforms.
We support the following platforms:
- Windows
- Linux
- MacOS

"Precompiled binaries" are the compiled version of the source code which is ready to run on your system.
It is a convenient way to install the software without the need to compile it from source code, but needs to trust the source of the binaries.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Running precompiled binaries from untrusted party can be a security risk.
</Callout>

To download the latest version available, please visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/releases).

If you don't see the precompiled binaries for your platform, you can always build from source code.

**NOTE**: We recommended building our software from source code directly, to be up-to-date but also to prevent having to trust a third party which could be a vector of attacks later.<br/>

A comprehensive guide to build from source code is available [here](/getting-started/build).
