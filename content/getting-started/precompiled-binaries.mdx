## Introduction

To give an easier way to install the software, we provide precompiled binaries for different platforms.

The following platforms are currently supported during our releases:
- Windows
- Linux
- MacOS

**Precompiled binaries** are the compiled version of the source code by a third party (in this, case, the developers) which is ready to run on your system.

It is a convenient way to install the software without the need to compile it from source code, but needs to trust the source of the binaries.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Running precompiled binaries from untrusted party can be a security risk.
</Callout>

## Download

For each **new version release**, we provide a zip for the mentioned platforms containing the **daemon**, **wallet** and **miner** binaries along checksums, documentation and license files.

To download the **latest version** available, please visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/releases).

<Callout type="info">
  We recommended building our software from source code directly,
  to be up-to-date but also to prevent having to trust a third party which could be a vector of attacks.
</Callout>

### Verification

Once you've downloaded the zip file it is **recommended** to verify the correct checksums of these binaries.

On Linux, you can achieve this by using the `sha256sum` and compare it to the provided checksums:
```bash copy
sha256sum <your_file>
```

### Unsupported platform

If you don't see the precompiled binaries for your platform, it is required to build from source code.

A comprehensive guide to build from source code is available [here](/getting-started/build-from-source-code).
