title: Daemon

## Introduction

Daemon is the name for a background program that runs continuously and keeps the blockchain node alive — it maintains the ledger,
connects to peers, validates blocks and transactions, and exposes an RPC interface so wallets or miners can interact with the network.

It connects to our P2P network, verifies transactions and blocks, and helps share data with other nodes to keep the system decentralized.

On XELIS, you can have differents two types of nodes.

### Full node

A **full node** is a type of blockchain node that downloads, stores, and validates the entire blockchain history
from the very first block (the genesis block) up to the current chain tip.

Because it has the complete record, it can independently verify every transaction and block without relying on others,
making it the **most secure and trustless** option.

However, this comes at the cost of significant disk space and bandwidth usage as the chain grows over time.

### Pruned node

A **pruned node**, on the other hand, still validates all blocks and transactions in the same way a full node does,
but it discards old historical data once it’s verified.

Instead of storing the full blockchain, it only keeps the most recent blocks that are necessary for consensus and for wallet balances to function.

This greatly reduces storage requirements, making it more practical for users with limited resources, while still contributing to the network’s decentralization and security.

## Install

This script makes it easy to onboard onto the network with just one step.

The script is compatible with Linux/MacOS directly and Windows using **Git Bash**.

It will clone the repository and install the required packages for compiling the source code.

On the first launch, it will ask if you want to download a bootstrap chain from the latest snapshot or sync from scratch using the requested sync mode.

A `start.sh` file will be generated to more easily start the daemon once closed without having to re-execute this script.

```bash copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.xelis.io/scripts/daemon-install.sh | sh
```
