## Introduction

**Docker** is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.
It uses Linux containers to deploy applications to any machine and treat them as a single server.

In case you prefer to use Docker, we provide a Docker image for each part of XELIS.

## Docker images

### Daemon

The daemon runs a XELIS node and connects to other nodes on the network.

You can easily download the image from the Docker Hub.

```bash copy
docker pull xelis/daemon
```

### Wallet

The wallet is used to manage your wallet on the network.

You can easily download the image from the Docker Hub.

```bash copy
docker pull xelis/wallet
```

### Miner

The miner performs Proof-Of-Work consensus computations on blocks to secure the network.
It must be connected to a daemon to work properly.

You can easily download the image from the Docker Hub.

```bash copy
docker pull xelis/miner
```
