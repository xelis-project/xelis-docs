## Introduction

**Smart Contracts** can be programmed using our own interpreted language running in a Virtual Machine, allowing safe and secure execution of code on the blockchain.

Smart Contracts are a way to automate the execution of a contract, without the need of a third party.
They are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code.

A lot of use cases can be found for Smart Contracts, such as:
- Decentralized applications (dApps)
- Tokenization of assets
- Voting systems
- Supply chain management
- etc.

Please note that they are not yet available on the mainnet, but are planned to be released in the future.

You can find the documentation of the [XVM](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-vm) below.

## Silex Lang
**Silex** is a statically typed programming language powered by XVM (XELIS Virtual Machine) with syntax that should feel familiar to those experienced with modern C-family languages.

**XVM** is a fully customizable VM built from scratch in Rust providing a robust & deterministic sandboxed environment.

This guide aims to describe its major features, from syntax to data structures and control flow, so that you can effectively write contracts in Silex.

Silex code typically consists of:
- **Constant declarations** (`const`)  
- **Functions** (`fn`, `entry`, `hook`)  
- **Struct** and **Enum** definitions  
- **Imports** for referencing other files  
- **Statements** (control flow, variable assignments, loops, etc.)

Every Silex contract can define several *entry* function‚Äîthis serves as the main entry point for external invocations.

## Lexical Elements

1. **Identifiers**:  
   - Must start with an alphabetic character (`[A-Za-z]`) and can contain letters, digits, or underscores.  
   - Examples: `myVar`, `Address1`, `_temporary` (although `_temporary` is valid, a single `_` is treated as an ignored placeholder variable).

2. **Keywords**:  
   Common keywords include `let`, `const`, `fn`, `enum`, `struct`, `entry`, `hook`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `foreach`, `in`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, etc.

3. **Semicolons**:  
   Silex has minimal semicolon usage. A newline often denotes the end of a statement, but semicolons may still appear to separate statements if desired. Some syntax forms (like `for` loops) explicitly use semicolons.

4. **Braces & Parentheses**:  
   - `{ ... }` typically denotes blocks or type constructors.  
   - `( ... )` encloses function parameters and subexpressions.  
   - `[ ... ]` encloses array elements or indices.

## Data Types

### Primitive Types

- `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `u256`: Unsigned integer types of various bit-widths.
- `bool`: Boolean type (`true` or `false`).
- `string`: UTF-8 text type.
- `null`: Special null value (only valid for optional types).

### Composite Types

- **Arrays**: Denoted by `T[]` where `T` is the element type. Multidimensional arrays become `T[][]`, etc.
- **Optional**: Denoted by `optional<T>`; can hold a value of type `T` or `null`.
- **Map**: Denoted by `map<K, V>`; a dictionary from keys `K` to values `V`. The key must not be another `map`.
- **Range**: Denoted by `range<T>`; a half-open or fully open range from one value to another of type `T` (usually a numeric type).
- **Struct**: A user-defined record type (see [Structs](#structs)).
- **Enum**: A user-defined discriminated union type (see [Enums](#enums)).

## Variables and Constants

### Variables

- Declared with `let`.
- Must specify a type and (usually) an initializer.
  
```rust
let x: u64 = 10
let greetings: string[] = ["hello", "world"]
```

- If a type is optional, you can omit the assignment and it will default to `null`:

```rust
let maybeValue: optional<u64> // defaults to null
```

- Silex disallows ‚Äúshadowing‚Äù by default if `set_shadowing_variables` is enabled, but can be permitted if that feature is disabled in the parser.

### Constants

- Declared with `const` and must be **uppercase**.
- Must have a compile-time‚Äìresolvable expression:

```rust
const MAX_SIZE: u64 = 100
```

- Named `_` is disallowed for constants.

## Expressions

Expressions in Silex include:

- **Literals**: e.g., `42`, `true`, `"hello"`, `null`.
- **Variable references**: `myVar`.
- **Array/map constructors**: e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `{ key: "value" }`.
- **Struct/enum constructors**: e.g., `MyStruct { fieldName }` or `MyEnum::VariantName { ... }`.
- **Operators** (arithmetic, logical, bitwise).
- **Function calls**: `fnName(arg1, arg2)`.
- **Member access**: `expr.field` or `expr.methodCall(...)`.
- **Indexing**: `myArray[2]`.
- **Casts**: `myVal as u32`.
- **Ternary**: `cond ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`.

## Operators

1. **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**` (power).
2. **Bitwise**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`.
3. **Comparisons**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.
4. **Logical**: `&&`, `||`, `isnot` (unary `isnot expr` flips a boolean).
5. **Assignment**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.  
   For example, `x += 5` is equivalent to `x = x + 5`.

Operator precedence is generally ‚ÄúC-like,‚Äù with power (`**`) and unary operators near the top, arithmetic/bitwise in the middle, and logical last.

## Flow Control

### `if` / `else`

```rust
if condition {
    // ...
} else if anotherCondition {
    // ...
} else {
    // ...
}
```

### Loops

#### `while`

```rust
while x < 10 {
    x += 1
}
```

#### `for` (C-style)

```rust
for i: u64 = 0; i < 10; i += 1 {
    // use i
}
```
This syntax includes an initializer (`i: u64 = 0`), a condition (`i < 10`), and an increment expression (`i += 1`).

#### `foreach`

```rust
foreach element in myArray {
    // element is the array‚Äôs element type
}
```

### `break` / `continue`

Use `break` to exit a loop immediately, and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.

### `return`

Returns from the current function, optionally with an expression if the function has a return type. If a function declares a return type, its final statement must ultimately return a value.

## Functions

Functions start with `fn`, `entry`, or `hook`. They have a name, an optional list of parameters, and an optional return type. **Entry** and **Hook** functions have special roles in a smart contract context.

```rust
fn add(a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 {
    return a + b
}
```

### Entry Functions

Marked by `entry`; there can be at most one or a limited number of them in a contract (depending on the environment). Typically, an entry function returns `u64`, though the parser can be configured to allow other types or no return type.

```rust
entry main() -> u64 {
    return 0
}
```

### Hook Functions

Marked by `hook`; these are special callbacks or event handlers invoked by the system. The environment typically imposes constraints on their name, parameters, and return types:

```rust
hook onDataReceived(data: u8[]) {
    // handle data
}
```

Currently `constructor()` is the only hook; it has no parameters and must return a u64 error code. `invoke: { max_gas: u64 }` needs to be added to the deploy_contract parameters. 

```rust
hook constructor() -> u64 {
    let storage: Storage = Storage::new();
    storage.store("owner", Transaction::current().source());
    return 0;
}
```

### Methods on Structs/Enums

A function can be declared as a ‚Äúmethod‚Äù by specifying `(varName Type)` before the function name:

```rust
fn (p Person) greet() -> string {
    return "Hello, " + p.name
}
```

This is akin to an instance method in other languages: `p` is the struct instance. You can only declare methods for a type that is locally defined (e.g. a `struct` or `enum` you own).

## Structs

Structs are user-defined composite types with named fields. By convention, struct names start with uppercase letters.

```rust
struct Person {
    name: string,
    age: u64
}
```

To instantiate:
```rust
let p: Person = Person { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
```
If you have a local variable `name` that matches the field name, you can shorthand it as `Person { name }`.

## Enums

Enums represent discriminated unions (sum types). Each variant may have zero or more fields:

```rust
enum Result {
    Ok { value: u64 },
    Err { message: string }
}
```

Create an instance:
```rust
let res: Result = Result::Ok { value: 123 }
```

Check a variant with pattern matching in a future extension or by calling environment-defined methods to see which variant is active.

## Imports

Use `import "someFile.slx"` to load external code. The parser enforces certain rules like preventing `..` and absolute paths:

```rust
import "helpers.slx"
```

*(Alias syntax or advanced scoping might be added later.)*

## Example Program

Below is a complete (albeit simple) Silex contract that demonstrates constants, variables, loops, a struct, an enum, and an entry function.

```rust
const MAX_COUNT: u64 = 5

struct Accumulator {
    sum: u64
}

enum Operation {
    Add { value: u64 },
    Reset
}

fn (acc Accumulator) doOperation(op: Operation) -> Accumulator {
    match op {
        Operation::Add { value } => {
            // If pattern matching is not directly supported yet,
            // we can parse the fields in future expansions.
            Accumulator { sum: acc.sum + value }
        },
        Operation::Reset => Accumulator { sum: 0 }
    }
}

entry main() -> u64 {
    // Create an instance of Accumulator
    let acc: Accumulator = Accumulator { sum: 0 }

    // Perform operations
    let updated: Accumulator = acc.doOperation(Operation::Add { value: 10 })
    let resetAcc: Accumulator = updated.doOperation(Operation::Reset)

    // Use a for-loop up to MAX_COUNT
    let mut result: u64 = 0
    for i: u64 = 0; i < MAX_COUNT; i += 1 {
        result += i
    }

    // Return the final result
    return result + resetAcc.sum
}
```

**Explanation**:
- We declare a constant `MAX_COUNT`.
- We define a `struct Accumulator` with a single field, `sum`.
- We define an `enum Operation` with two variants: `Add` and `Reset`.
- We create a method `doOperation` on `Accumulator` that takes an `Operation` and returns a new `Accumulator`.
- The `entry main` function is the main entry point, returning a `u64`.
