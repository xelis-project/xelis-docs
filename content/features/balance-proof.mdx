# Balance Proof

A **Balance Proof** is a cryptographic proof that reveals the **exact total balance** of an asset owned by the prover.

Unlike Ownership Proof which only proves a minimum threshold, Balance Proof discloses the **complete balance** while still being privacy-preserving through zero-knowledge cryptography.

This is useful for scenarios like:
- Full transparency audits
- Complete financial disclosure when required
- Verifying exact asset holdings without revealing transaction history
- Settlement protocols that require full balance visibility

Balance proofs are encoded as **bech32 strings** with the prefix `proof:`, making them easy to share with other parties.

## How it works

When you create a balance proof, the proof demonstrates your **exact asset balance** without revealing how you acquired it or any transaction history.

It enable third-parties to verify your exact balance of the specified asset at that topoheight.

### Topoheight specificity

Balance proofs are created **against a specific topoheight** because they are validated against the balance ciphertext stored at that topoheight. This means:
- A proof is only valid for the topoheight it was created against
- If you check the same asset balance at a later topoheight, you must generate a new proof
- This ensures **temporal integrity** and prevents replay attacks

## Advantages

- **Complete transparency**: When you need to prove your exact holdings
- **Privacy-preserving**: Transaction amounts history and other assets remain hidden
- **Temporary validity**: Tied to a specific topoheight for freshness
- **Easy sharing**: Bech32 format for convenient transmission
- **No transaction required**: Proof generation is local and doesn't create a blockchain transaction
- **Complete assets support**: Supports any asset available in the user wallet
- **Contract compatibility**: Balance Proofs can also be shared to a smart contract for various use cases, as it is directly supported by the protocol

## Use cases

### Regulatory compliance

A user fully discloses their exact balance of an asset to a regulator without revealing transaction history:

```
User generates balance proof for 50000 XELIS at topoheight 50000
↓
Shares proof: proof:1qyqszqgpq...
↓
Regulator verifies proof against the ciphertext at topoheight 50000
↓
Verification passes, exact balance confirmed: 50000 XELIS ✓
```

### Insurance or bonding requirement

A service requires exact proof of balance for insurance purposes:

```
User proof: "I own exactly 1000 XELIS at topoheight 50050"
↓
Insurance protocol verifies proof ✓
↓
User qualifies for service based on proven balance
```

### Audit or financial reporting

An auditor verifies a user's exact asset holdings at a specific time:

```
Auditor requests balance proof at topoheight 50100
↓
User generates proof: "exact balance: 2500 XELIS"
↓
Auditor verifies and records exact balance
↓
Transaction history remains private ✓
```

### Multi-asset settlement

Multiple parties reveal their exact balances for a settlement without transaction history disclosure:

```
Alice: "I own exactly 100 XELIS at topoheight 50100"
Bob:   "I own exactly 50 XELIS at topoheight 50100"
↓
Both proofs verified at the same topoheight
↓
Settlement proceeds with known exact amounts
```

## Limitations

- **Complete disclosure**: Your exact balance is revealed (cannot partially disclose)
- **Temporary validity**: Only valid against the topoheight it was created for
- **Forward-only**: After balance changes (new blocks), you need a new proof
- **No backward proof**: Cannot use an old proof against a future (or older) topoheight
