## Introduction

An **Ownership Proof** is a cryptographic proof that demonstrates the prover owns a specific amount of an asset, **without revealing their full balance**.

This is a privacy-preserving mechanism that allows you to selectively disclose only the amount you choose, making it ideal for scenarios like:
- Proving sufficient funds for a purchase or loan
- KYC/AML compliance (proving minimum balance threshold)
- Selective sharing of balance information with third parties

Ownership proofs are encoded as **bech32 strings** with the prefix `proof:`, making them easy to share with other parties.

These Ownership Proofs are generated locally by the user and do not require an on-chain transaction, ensuring privacy and convenience.

An Ownership Proof is valid only for a specific topoheight, as it is tied to the balance ciphertext stored at that topoheight.

## How it works

When you create an ownership proof, you specify a target amount.

The proof demonstrates that you own **at least that amount** of a given asset, without disclosing your actual balance.

### Topoheight specificity

Ownership proofs are created **against a specific topoheight** because they are validated against the balance ciphertext stored at that topoheight. This means:
- A proof is only valid for the topoheight it was created against
- If you check the same asset balance at a later topoheight, you must generate a new proof
- This ensures **temporal integrity** and prevents replay attacks

### Privacy preservation

The proof only reveals the amount you specified when creating it. Your actual balance remains hidden:

- You prove you own **≥ amount** of asset X
- The verifier learns only that you meet the threshold
- Your true balance is never disclosed
- It is only valid for a specific time (topoheight), ensuring freshness

## Advantages

- **Selective disclosure**: Share balance information on your terms
- **Privacy-preserving**: Full balance remains confidential
- **Temporary validity**: Tied to a specific topoheight for freshness
- **Easy sharing**: Bech32 format for convenient transmission
- **No transaction required**: Proof generation is local and doesn't create a blockchain transaction
- **Complete assets support**: Supports any asset available in the user wallet.
- **Contract compatibility**: Ownership Proofs can also be shared to a smart contract for various use cases, as it is directly supported by the protocol.

## Use cases

### KYC/AML verification

A user proves they have a minimum balance (e.g., 1000 XELIS) without revealing their total holdings:

```
User generates proof for 1000 XELIS at topoheight 50000
↓
Shares proof: proof:1qyqszqgpq...
↓
Service verifies proof against the ciphertext at topoheight 50000
↓
Verification passes, KYC requirement met ✓
```

### Collateral verification

A lending protocol verifies a user has sufficient collateral without knowing their total balance:

```
User proof: "I own ≥ 500 XELIS at topoheight 50050"
↓
Protocol verifies proof ✓
↓
User can borrow against their collateral without full balance disclosure
```

### Multi-party settlement

Multiple parties prove they have sufficient funds for a transaction without revealing balances to each other:

```
Alice: proof for 100 XELIS at topoheight 50100
Bob:   proof for 50 XELIS at topoheight 50100
↓
Both proofs verified at the same topoheight
↓
Settlement can proceed with privacy intact
```

## Limitations

- **Temporary validity**: Only valid against the topoheight it was created for
- **Forward-only**: After balance changes (new blocks), you need a new proof
- **No backward proof**: Cannot use an old proof against a future (or older) topoheight
