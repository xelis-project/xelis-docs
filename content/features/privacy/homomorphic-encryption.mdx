## Introduction

Homomorphic Encryption (also known as HE) is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext.
The purpose of homomorphic encryption is to allow computation on encrypted data without decrypting it.
The result of the computation is also encrypted, and can be decrypted to obtain the result of the computation on the plaintext.

Homomorphic Encryption makes XELIS transactions and accounts more private by doing computation while staying in encrypted form.
All balances, and transaction asset values are in encrypted form and nobody can determine the real value of it except involved parties.

## ElGamal

ElGamal is a public-key cryptosystem that is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985.
In XELIS, we use an implementation of ElGamal cryptosystem to encrypt the data and perform operations on the encrypted data thanks of its homomorphic properties.

In order to have easier compatibility with Bulletproofs for transactions verification and thus, faster verification time, we use a Twisted ElGamal implementation.
This consists in the use of Pedersen commitments in every ciphertexts directly to take part of encryption / decryption process.

The homomorphic properties and security of the Twisted ElGamal implementation are exactly the same as the original ElGamal implementation.

## Homomorphic Properties

ElGamal Homomorphic Encryption has three main properties:
- **Additive**: Given two ciphertexts `c1` and `c2` that encrypts `m1` and `m2` respectively, we can compute a new ciphertext `c3` that encrypts `m1 + m2` without decrypting `c1` and `c2`.
- **Multiplicative**: Given a ciphertext `c1` that encrypts `m1` and a plaintext `m2`, we can compute a new ciphertext `c2` that encrypts `m1 * m2` without decrypting `c1`.
- **Subtractive**: Given two ciphertexts `c1` and `c2` that encrypts `m1` and `m2` respectively, we can compute a new ciphertext `c3` that encrypts `m1 - m2` without decrypting `c1` and `c2`.

For the protocol, we only use addition to increase receiver's balance and subtraction to decrease sender's balance.
Multiplication is not needed in a traditional blockchain protocol as we are only transferring exact values from one to another account without changing the amount.

## Why ElGamal?

ElGamal is a well-known and widely used cryptosystem. It is compatible with the curve25519 curve through Ristretto Points, which is used in XELIS.
It is also a very secure cryptosystem, and it has homomorphic properties that are useful for our protocol.

We didn't chose a FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) cryptosystem because it is very slow and not adapted to our use case as we only need to perform additions and subtractions.

Operations in ElGamal do not change the size of the ciphertext, allowing the ciphertext to remain the same size after many operations.
In most FHE schemes, ciphertexts grow after each operation using additional "noise".
The variable size and additional complexity found in most FHE schemes makes them unfit for our use case.
