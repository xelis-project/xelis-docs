# Tokenomics

## Max supply

XELIS has a fixed maximum supply of **18.4M** XEL.

## Mining reward

Mining block starts at around ~1.41 XEL and decreases each subsequent block. 
This reduction isn't based on halving logic but rather on the supply and emission factor of 20.

Based on how the DAG react, your reward can be lower due to side blocks, this would give you minimum 5% and maximum 30% of initial reward based on the count of side blocks at same height.

Note: This table does not account for side blocks. As a result, the max supply may reach the 18.4M limit slightly sooner than expected.
