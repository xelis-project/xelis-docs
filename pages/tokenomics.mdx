## Introduction

Tokenomics refers to the economic design of a cryptocurrency or token, including how it is created, distributed, and used within its ecosystem.
Key aspects include:
- the maximum supply (the total number of coins that can ever exist)
- the circulating supply (coins currently available to the public)
- the emission schedule (the rate at which new coins are generated),
- and the inflation rate (how supply grows relative to what is already in circulation).

## Specifications

XELIS (XEL) features a **fixed** maximum supply of **18.4 million XEL**, emphasizing scarcity and long-term value.
Unlike cryptocurrencies that use halving schedules, XELIS distributes mining rewards dynamicallyâ€”each block starts at approximately 1.41 XEL
and gradually decreases based on its current supply and a consistent emission speed factor of **20**.

Additionally, the mining reward may vary due to the blockDAG architecture; specifically,
rewards can drop to as low as **5%** or up to **30%** of the initial block reward depending on the frequency of side blocks at the same height.

This design leads to a smoothly asymptotic emission curve.
