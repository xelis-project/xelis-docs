title: Miner Configuration
---

## Introduction

A **CPU miner** allows you to participate in securing the **XELIS** network by contributing your computerâ€™s central processing unit (CPU) power to validate transactions and produce new blocks.

Unlike specialized hardware such as GPUs or ASICs, CPU mining uses the processing resources already built into most desktop and laptop computers,
making it the **most accessible** way to start mining.

This approach is particularly useful for newcomers who want to support the network,
test configurations, or mine with spare capacity on personal machines.
While CPUs are generally less powerful than dedicated mining hardware, they provide an easy, **low-barrier** entry point into the XELIS ecosystem.

The XELIS CPU miner is **lightweight**, integrates directly with the node software, and requires minimal setup,
allowing anyone to start mining and earning XEL rewards with just a few configuration steps.

## Configuration

Run `./xelis_miner --help` to see all available options.

### Miner Address

Set the miner address. This address is used to and earn mining rewards.

This is a **mandatory** option.

Example: `./xelis_miner --miner-address <YOUR_ADDRESS>`.

### Daemon Address

Set the daemon address to which you want to connect.
By default, the miner connects to the a local node at `127.0.0.1:8080`.

To connect to another node (domain or ip:port format), use: `./xelis_miner --daemon-address testnet-node.xelis.io`.

### Benchmark

Enable the benchmark mode. This will run the miner without submitting any block and will print the hashrate of the miner.

To enable the benchmark mode, use: `./xelis_miner --benchmark`.

In case you want to changes the number of iterations to use for the benchmark, use: `./xelis_miner --benchmark --iterations 100`.

### Numbers of Threads

Set the number of threads to use for the miner.
By default, the numbers of threads is set to the number of logical cores of the CPU.

Minimum is 1 and maximum is 255.

Example to set the numbers of threads to 4: `./xelis_miner --num-threads 4`.

### Worker

Set the worker name to use for the miner. This is useful to identify the miner in the daemon.<br/>
Default is set to `default`.

Example to set the worker name to `myworker`: `./xelis_miner --worker myworker`.

### Disable File Logging

By default, the daemon is logging to a file. To disable it, use: `./xelis_miner --disable-file-logging`.

### Disable Date-Based File Log Naming

Disable date-based file naming for logs. If disabled, the log file will be named xelis-daemon.log instead of YYYY-MM-DD.xelis-daemon.log

To disable, use: `./xelis_miner --disable-file-log-date-based`.

### Disable Log Colors

Disable the usage of colors in the log.

To disable, use: `./xelis_miner --disable-log-color`.

### Disable Interactive Mode

Disable terminal interactive mode. You will not be able to write CLI commands in it or have an updated prompt.

To disable, use: `./xelis_miner --disable-interactive-mode`.

### Filename Log

Set a custom log file name. By default, the filename is set to `xelis-miner.log`.<br/>
Log file are stored in the `logs` folder and are named with the date of the day.

To set the filename to `mylog.log`, use: `./xelis_miner --filename-log mylog.log`.

### Logs Modules

Module configuration for logs.

To set, use: `./xelis_miner --logs-modules module_name=off`.

### Logs Dir Path

Set a custom directory path to store the logs files.<br/>
By default it will be `logs/` of the current directory.

To set the directory path to `mylogs/`, use: `./xelis_miner --logs-path mylogs/`.

**NOTE**: The directory will be created using the provided path if it does not exist. The path must end with a `/`. 

### Log Level

Set the log level to use. Available values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

By default, the log level is set to `info`.

Example to set the log level to debug: `./xelis_miner --log-level debug`.

### File Log Level

Set the file log level to use. Available values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

This is useful to have a different log level for the file log than the console log.

By default, the file log level is set to value passed to `--log-level` (which is also `info` by default).

To set the file log level to debug: `./xelis_miner --file-log-level debug`.

### Version

Print the version of the miner.

To print the version, use: `./xelis_miner --version`.
