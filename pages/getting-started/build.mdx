title: Build from sources

import { Steps } from 'nextra-theme-docs';

**This guide will shows you how to easily build XELIS from sources.**

<Steps>
### Install Git (if not already installed)

Official Git installation guide at https://git-scm.com/downloads.

This software allows you to clone the project directly on your device.

### Install Rust and Cargo (if not already installed)

Official Rust installation guide at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

Rust is the programming language used by XELIS.

It is a compiled language that needs its toolchain to produce binaries from sources to work on your device.

Cargo is the package manager of Rust and allows for easier build, dependencies managements and much more.

### Clone the blockchain repository

Open your operating system's command-line interface (CLI) and download the source code using Git.

`git clone https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain`

This will create a local copy of the source code in a folder named `xelis-blockchain`.

### Navigate to the repository

Navigate to the repository using the following command:
`cd xelis-blockchain`

### Build the project with Cargo

`cargo build --bin xelis_daemon`

To build all project (daemon, wallet, miner), use `cargo build`.  
To build a release version in production-ready mode with optimizations, use `cargo build --release`.  
To run immediately in debug mode, use `cargo run --bin xelis_daemon`.

> **NOTE**:
> It is recommended to build it using `--release` for production / mainnet usage.
> Otherwise, your syncing speed will be too slow.
> 
> Developers who want to contribute should build in debug mode for faster build times.
> 

After building the binary, run the executable available in  
`./target/debug` or `./target/release`

### Run it

Now that you have successfully built the software, see [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration).
