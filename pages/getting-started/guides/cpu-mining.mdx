title: Mine using CPU Miner
---

import { Steps } from 'nextra-theme-docs';

## Introduction

XELIS is a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, which means that miners must solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain and receive rewards.
Their tasks are to find a hash that matches the difficulty target set by the network, ensuring that the block is valid and accepted by the network.

The main role of the miner is to secure the network by validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain.

XELIS Miner is a CLI (Command Line Interface) software in which you interact using the command line in a terminal.
It is cross-platform and precompiled binaries are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Please note that XELIS Miner is optimized for CPU mining only, it is not using your GPU.

Some others third parties miners are available for CPU and/or GPU mining, but we recommend using the official one to ensure the best compatibility, support and security as it is fully open-source.

## Requirements

In order to follow this guide, it requires that you already have the miner software on your device and a valid wallet address to receive your rewards in case of a block found and accepted by the network.

If you don't have one, please follow the [Create your wallet using CLI](/getting-started/guides/create-wallet-cli) page.

## Run the miner

<Steps>
### Open a terminal

Open a terminal on your device.

### Start the miner

Run the following command to start the miner:

On Windows:
```bash
xelis_miner.exe --miner-address <your-wallet-address>
```

On Linux:
```bash
./xelis_miner --miner-address <your-wallet-address>
```

Your wallet address should be replaced with your own wallet address.
It must be a valid XELIS wallet address in the network wanted.

For example, if you want to mine on the mainnet, you should use a mainnet wallet address.

### Configuration

In case you want to configure the miner, please see all the available options by running the following command:

On Windows:
```bash
xelis_miner.exe --help
```

On Linux:
```bash
./xelis_miner --help
```

Or you can check the [documentation](/getting-started/configuration/miner) for more details.

### Monitor your miner

You can monitor your miner by reviewing the logs in the terminal.
Theses logs provide real-time updates on your miner's status, including whether you have found a block,
if it has been accepted or rejected, and your current hashrate.

If you want to monitor it while being away from the machine and avoid connecting directly to it,
you can use the explorer as quick alternative.

`https://explorer.xelis.io/accounts/{your_address}`

Replace the placeholder address with your account address. This page is automatically updated; you don't have to manually refresh.
