## Start a miner

XELIS is a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, meaning that miners are needed to secure the network and validate transactions.
In this guide, we will show you how to start a miner on the XELIS network.

XELIS Miner is a CLI (Command Line Interface) software in which you interact using the command line in a terminal.

### Requirements

In order to follow this guide, it requires that you already have the miner software on your device and a valid wallet address to receive your rewards in case of a block found and accepted by the network.

If you don't have one, please follow the [Create your wallet using CLI](/getting-started/guides/create-wallet-cli) page.

### Run the miner

<Steps>
### Open a terminal

Open a terminal on your device.

### Start the miner

Run the following command to start the miner:

On Windows:
```bash
xelis-miner.exe --wallet-address <your-wallet-address>
```

On Linux:
```bash
./xelis-miner --wallet-address <your-wallet-address>
```

Your wallet address should be replaced with your own wallet address.
It must be a valid XELIS wallet address in the network wanted.

For example, if you want to mine on the mainnet, you should use a mainnet wallet address.

### Monitor your miner

You can monitor your miner by reviewing the logs in the terminal.
Theses logs provide real-time updates on your miner's status, including whether you have found a block, 
if it has been accepted or rejected, and your current hashrate.

If you want to monitor it while being away from the machine and avoid connecting directly to it, 
you can use the explorer as quick alternative.

`https://explorer.xelis.io/accounts/{your_address}`

Replace the placeholder address with your account address. This page is automatically updated; you don't have to manually refresh.
