# XELIS Stratum Protocol

**Version:** 0.1.1<br/>
**Last Updated:** 5/5/2024<br/>
**Authors**: [Vipor.net](https://vipor.net)<br/>

This document describes a protocol, that allows a group of miners to connect
to a server, which coordinates the distribution of work packages among
miners.

The initial protocol was written for Bitcoin and contains several pieces that
need adjustment in order to be usable with XELIS.

## Specification

### Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

The stratum protocol mostly adheres to the [JSON RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification.

### Overview

Communication happens over a bidirectional channel with messages encoded as
JSON with `LF` delimiter—in this document written as `\n`.

Since requests can be handled out of order, each request in a session SHOULD
have an unique `id`. In order to be able to match request and response,
responses MUST have the same `id` as their matching request. Notifications
sent by the server or calls that do not trigger any response MAY have an `id` of
`null`.

For further details on the members of request and response objects consult the
[JSON RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).


### Protocol flow example

The following shows what a session might look like from subscription to
submitting a solution.

```
Client                                Server
  |                                     |
  | --------- mining.subscribe -------> |
  | --------- mining.authorize -------> |
  | <-------- mining.set_difficulty --- |
  |                                     |----
  | <---------- mining.notify --------- |<--/
  |                                     |
  | ---------- mining.submit ---------> |
```

### New difficulty protocol flow example

The following shows what communication may look like when a new difficulty is set for a miner.

```
Client                                Server
  |                                     |
  | <-------- mining.set_difficulty --- |
  | <---------- mining.notify --------- |
  |                                     |
  | ---------- mining.submit ---------> |
```

### Methods
- [mining.subscribe](#miningsubscribe)
- [mining.authorize](#miningauthorize)
- [mining.notify](#miningnotify)
- [mining.submit](#miningsubmit)
- [mining.set_difficulty](#miningset_difficulty)
- [mining.set_extranonce](#miningset_extranonce)
- [mining.ping](#miningping)
- [mining.pong](#miningpong)
- [mining.print](#miningprint)
- [mining.hashrate](#mininghashrate)


### Errors

Whenever an RPC call triggers an error, the response MUST include an `error` field which maps to a **list** of the following values:

- `code` : `int`
- `message` : `string`
- `data` : `object`

```json
{"id": 10, "result": null, "error": {"code": 20, "message": "Invalid request", "data": null}}
```

Errors SHOULD be identified by their `code` and programs SHOULD do error handling based on the `code` and not the `message`.
Available error codes, in addition to the codes defined in the [JSON RPC 2.0]() specification, are:

- `20` - Other/Unknown
- `21` - Job not found (=stale)
- `22` - Duplicate share
- `23` - Low difficulty share
- `24` - Unauthorized worker

The `message` field SHOULD be a concise description of the error for human
consumption.

Implementors MAY choose to include an optional `data` object with additional
information relevant to the error.

Including `null` value in `error` object is against the JSON RPC spec. Error should only be included in the response when there is an actual error.

## `MinerWork` Structure
- `112` **bytes total**
- `32` bytes (`0-31`) **Header work hash**
- `8` bytes (`32-39`) **timestamp** _provided in mining.notify_
- `8` bytes (`40-47`) **nonce** _miner value_
- `32` bytes (`48-79`) **extra nonce** _provided in mining.subscribe_
- `32` bytes (`80-111`) **public key** _provided in mining.subscribe_


### mining.subscribe

In order to initiate a session with the server, a client needs to call the subscribe method.

This method call will only be executed by clients.


#### Request:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "method": "mining.subscribe",
  "params": ["MyMiner/1.0.0", ["xel/v2"]]
}
```

- `id` : `int`: request id
- `method` : `string`: RPC method name
- `params` : `[ string, [ string ] ]`
  1. MUST be the name and version of the mining software in the given format or an empty string.
  2. OPTIONAL, specifies a list of supported mining algorithms. If omitted, a default algorithm `xel/v2` or the most recent algorithm will be used.
  _As of 7/11/2024 XELIS only supports one algo `xel/v2`_

Miners please use `xel/v2`

Pool operators, for backwards compatibility, you should also support `xel/1`.  The stratum protocol originally used `xel/0` and `xel/1` but the node uses `xel/v1` and `xel/v2`. As a pool operator, if a miner sends `xel/1` you should consider this to be `xel/v2`

#### Response

```json
{ 
  "id": 1,
  "result": [
    "ABC123",
    "EXTRANONCE",
    32,
    "7e40899c7bcc885fad6dd3bdc68fa73141c1d8b917a1f399afeb1fb191376b16"
  ]
}
```

- `id` : `int`: request id
- `result` : `[ string, string, int, string ]`:
    1. This SHOULD be a unique session id
    2. Extra nonce for the miner to use (in hex format)
    3. The length of the extra nonce in bytes
    4. The public key to use (in hex format)

### mining.authorize

Before a client can submit solutions to a server it MUST authorize at least one worker.

This method call will only be executed by clients.

#### Request

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "method": "mining.authorize",
  "params": ["xel:WALLET_ADDRESS", "WORKER_NAME", "WORKER_PASSWORD"]
}
```

- `id` : `int`: request id
- `method` : `string`: RPC method name
- `params` : `[ string, string, string ]`
    1. The miner wallet address
    2. The worker name
    3. The worker password


#### Response

```json
{"id": 2, "result": true }
```

- `id` : `int`: request id
- `result` : `boolean`:
    - MUST be `true` if the worker was authorized
    - MUST be `false` if the worker was not authorized
    - If the worker was not authorized, the server MUST respond with an error
      message

### mining.notify

The notify call is used to supply a worker with new work to be processed.

This method call will only be executed by the server.


#### Request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "method": "mining.notify",
  "params": [
    "abc123",
    "19726D97F49",
    "d9da51a0c3f8a1784911d370fdb617ea7f41581f5059d31e35f176b85efa5570",
    "xel/0",
    true
  ]
}
```

- `id` : `int`: request id
- `method` : `string`: RPC method name
- `params` : `[ string, int, string, string, bool ]`
    1. Job ID
    2. Timestamp milliseconds (in hex format)
    3. Header work hash (`32` bytes) - Blake3 hash of the block header (immutable)
    4. Algorithm name
    5. A boolean indicating whether the miners job queue should be emptied or not ("clean jobs")
       - Majority of the time this is meant for signifying to the miner that the block they are mining has already been found, and they should start mining on a new block height.

Miner should use the `timestamp` and `header work hash` to generate the [MinerWork Structure](#minerwork-structure), updating the nonce until a solution is found and then submit the nonce from any solutions found (below in `mining.submit`).

#### Response

There is no explicit response for this call.


### mining.submit

With this method a worker can submit solutions for the mining puzzle.
This method call will only be executed by clients.

#### Request

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "method": "mining.submit",
